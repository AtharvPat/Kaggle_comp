## **About this Repository** 📜

This repository contains a collection of notebooks from various [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions in which I have participated or am currently participating. The notebooks span diverse domains such as regression, classification, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision, covering competitions ranging from beginner-friendly tasks (like the Titanic dataset) to more complex problems involving transformer architectures and bioinformatics.

Each notebook is structured to include data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. Some notebooks also incorporate advanced techniques like deep learning and ensemble models. Whether you're looking for inspiration or solutions to similar problems, this repository offers valuable insights and practical knowledge.
